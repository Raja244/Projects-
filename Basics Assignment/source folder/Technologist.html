 maps, the Google Play Store, YouTube, and Android.</li><br><br>

 new scooter, but made sure Pichai and his brother had the best education the family could afford,
 at <b>Padma Seshadri Bala Bhavan.</b></li><br><br>


<li> Pichai's father told Bloomberg he believes that talking to young Sundar about the challenges
 in his work as an electrical engineer led to his son's interest in technology.</li><br><br>


<li> In 2013, Pichai took over Android founder <b>Andy Rubin's portfolio</b> to run mobile platforms. He
 was also entrusted with wooing more than a billion global users to the Android ecosystem.</li><br><br>


<li> 	According to Business Insider, Pichai was skilled at staying out of politics and drama at
 Google. When he reported to <b>Marissa Mayer</b>, he reportedly sat outside her office for hours, if necessary,
 to make sure his team had good performance reviews.</li><br><br>

 and noted that this simplicity was reflected in his demeanor. </li><br><br>



<li>	Pichai is known for his <b>soft-spoken</b>, diplomatic nature. <i>In 2013</i>, he accompanied Larry
 Page and Google CBO <b>Nikesh Arora</b> to tour a Samsung factory in South Korea to help build Google's relationship with its partner.</li><br><br>
