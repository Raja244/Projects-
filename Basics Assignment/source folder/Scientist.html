<b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> 15 October 1931 – 27 July 2015) was an Indian aerospace scientist and politician who served as
 the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born and raised in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu and studied physics and aerospace 
 engineering. He spent the next four decades as a scientist and science administrator, mainly at the Defence Research and Development 
 Organisation (DRDO) and Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) and was intimately involved in India's civilian space programme and 
 military missile development efforts. He thus came to be known as the <b><i>Missile Man of India</b></i> for his work on the development of ballistic 
 missile and launch vehicle technology. He also played a pivotal organisational, technical, and political role in India's <b><i>Pokhran-II</b></i> nuclear
 tests in 1998, the first since the original nuclear test by India in 1974.<br><br></p>

 Kalam was elected as the 11th President of India in 2002 with the support of both the ruling <b><i>Bharatiya Janata Party</b></i> 
 and the then-opposition <b><i>Indian National Congress. </b></i> Widely referred to as the "People's President", he returned to his 
 civilian life of education, writing and public service after a single term. He was a recipient of several prestigious awards, including the 
 <b><i>Bharat Ratna, </b></i> India's highest civilian honour.<br><br></p>

 While delivering a lecture at the <b><i>Indian Institute of Management Shillong </b></i>, Kalam collapsed and died from an apparent 
 cardiac arrest on 27 July 2015, aged 83. Thousands, including national-level dignitaries, attended the funeral ceremony held in his hometown 
 of Rameshwaram, where he was buried with full state honours.

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was his first ever invention, gor his college project, he made a double engine powered hovercraft named “Nandhi”.
 It was completed after a lot of struggle and it managed to fly above 1 foot from ground with two persons in it.</font></p>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pokhran-2 consisted of five detonations, the first was a fusion bomb and the remaining four were fission bombs.
 These nuclear tests resulted in a variety of sanctions against India by a number of major countries, including Japan and the United States.
 Pokhran 1 was tested on 1974. The interesting fact about Pokhran 2 testing was, it maintained high secrecy so that no one detects the testing and
 they succeeded in it by avoiding the spy satellites and CIA satellites by calculating the blind spot and time. India’s first indigenous Satellite 
 Launch Vehicle At the time, India had not even dreamt about Satellite Launch Vehicle, but Dr. Kalam’s, who worked hard for over a decade, made it 
 possible for us to develop our first indigenous SLV. SLV III injected Rohini satellite in the near-earth orbit in July 1980 making India an exclusive 
 Space Club member.</font></p>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While India has been declared polio free by the WHO, In 1995 and 1996, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam and his team worked hard 
 to produce orthosis calipers that weighed almost 1/10th of the weight of those that were available in the market. These floor reaction calipers 
 made movement and walking less painful for patients with motor disabilities allowing kids to walk more freely and fluidly without much help.</font></p>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the 1970s, Kalam also directed two projects, namely, Project Devil and Project Valiant, 
 which sought to develop ballistic missiles from the technology of the successful SLV programme. Despite the disapproval 
 of Union Cabinet, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi allotted secret funds for these aerospace projects through her discretionary
 powers under Kalam’s directorship. Kalam played an integral role convincing the Union Cabinet to conceal the true nature of 
 these classified aerospace projects.</font></p>
