 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first, Subhas Chandra Bose worked under <b>Chittaranjan Das</b>,
 a member from the Congress in Calcutta. Subhas Chandra Bose viewed Chittaranjan Das as
 his <i>political master</i>. He himself began the paper <b>‘Swaraj’</b>, edited Das’ paper ‘Forward’ 
 and as the CEO of <b>Calcutta Municipal Corporation</b> worked under Das’ who himself was a Mayor.</font></p><br><br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 1928, during the Guwahati Session of the Congress, 
 there was a difference of opinions between the new and the old members of the Congress.
 Although youthful members wanted <i>“total self-rule and with no bargain"</i>, the seniors were
 agreeable to the <i>“domain status for India inside the British principle”</i>. The gaps between 
 moderate Gandhi and dynamic Subhas Chandra Bose expanded to unfriendly degrees and Subhas 
 Chandra Bose chose to leave the group in 1939. He formed the Forward Bloc that year.</font></p><br><br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In January 1941, Subhas Chandra Bose escaped and reached Berlin, 
 Germany by means of a bypass through <i>Peshawar</i>. Germans guaranteed him their full help. Moreover,
 he was successful in attracting the loyalty of Japan as well. He took a risky adventure back
 east and reached Japan. There he was able to form an army of more than <i>40,000 fighters</i> who
 had come from Singapore and other South East Asian areas.</font></p><br><br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He named his military the <b>‘Indian National Army’ (INA)</b>. Along with his
 army him he was able to capture the <i>Andaman and Nicobar islands</i> from the British and renamed it
 as <i>Shaheed and Swaraj Islands</i>. Thereafter, a provisional <b>“Azad Hind Government”</b> began ruling the
 islands. The INA or the Azad Hind Fauj looking for India as the next stop crossed Burma Border.
 It set up on Indian soil on <b>March 18, 1944</b>. However, fate had other things in store. The tide
 of the World War turned and the Japanese and German powers surrendered which constrained him 
 to cancel further progression.</font></p>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After the retreat, Subhas Chandra <i>vanished mysteriously</i>.
 It is said that he returned to Singapore. There he met Field Marshal Hisaichi Terauchi,
 leader of South East Asia who arranged him a trip to Tokyo. He boarded a <b>Mitsubishi Ki-21</b> aircraft
 from Saigon Airport on <b>August 17, 1945</b>. The next day the plane crashed soon after take-off 
 following a night end in <i>Taiwan</i>. Witnesses report that Subhas Chandra Bose suffered from
 third-degree burns. He succumbed to his wounds on <b>Aug 18, 1945</b>. Eventually, he was cremated
 on <b>August 20</b> in Taihoku Crematorium and his ashes were kept at the Renkoji Temple of Nichiren
 <i>Buddhism</i> in Tokyo. Since then his remains have been kept there.</font></p><br><br>

 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government of India set up various advisory groups to research the case.
 First, <b>the Figgess Report in 1946</b> and after that <b>the Shah Nawaz Committee in 1956</b>, concluded that Subahs
 Chandra Bose had without a doubt died in the accident in Taiwan. However, it still remains a
 mystery as to what happened on that fateful day. Maybe someday the people would come to the 
 terms of what happened to Subhas Chandra Bose, the person everyone admired so much.</font></p>
